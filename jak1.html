      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is the first of an immersive
        platforming trilogy. The series starts off in a cozy place called
        Sandover Village; home to our protagonists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story follows two friends, named Jak and Daxter. The two have a bad
        habit of not listening to their wise caretaker, Samos the Sage. Despite
        constant warning from the old man, Jak and Daxter "borrowed" the local
        fisherman's boat to venture to Misty Island; a dangerous place crawling
        with ravenous beasts known as lurkers.
      </p>
      <p>
        After sneaking onto Misty Island the boys begin snooping around, when
        they stumble upon two villanous-looking people instructing a crowd of
        lurkers. After the crowd disperses, the boys continue exploring around
        and find a giant pool of dark-eco; a magical precursor essence which
        contains dark power. A lurker brute appears suddenly and lunges towards
        the boys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jak being the brave type he is, picks up a precursor relic and attempts
        to use it in self defense. Unfortunately, the blast launches him
        backward into Daxter, who is standing directly in front of the dark-eco
        pool. A few moments later and something emerges from the pool, but it
        doesn't look like Daxter...

      <p>
        What emerges from the pool of dark-eco certainly is Daxter, but he's a
        little bit shorter. Instead of coming back out normally, he returns from
        the pool in a new form; the form of an Ottsel. An Ottsel is a hybrid
        between an otter and a weasel, with orange and yellow fur.
      </p>
      <p>
        The duo immediately starts panicking and promptly return home to
        Sandover Village. They go to the one person who may know a thing or two
        about this stuff; Samos. Unfortunately for the boys, not only do they
        get lectured by the sage, but Samos also admits that he doesn't know the
        full extent of power that dark-eco has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all hope is lost, however. Samos begins to speak of someone who
        studies dark-eco and may know a way to return Daxter to his human form.
        Far, far to the north lives another sage; Gol Acheron, the dark-eco
        sage. Samos explains how Gol is the only one who would know how to
        revert the effects of the dark eco on Daxter.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this moment on, the duo of Jak and Daxter embark on their long
        journey to far away lands, encountering other sages, monsters, and
        dangerous terrain. Crossing through jungles, mountains, volcanos, and
        oceans to reach this dark-eco expert.
