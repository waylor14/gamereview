        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is the first of an immersive
          platforming trilogy. The series starts off in a cozy place called
          Sandover Village; home to our protagonists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story follows two friends, named Jak and Daxter. The two have a
          bad habit of not listening to their wise caretaker, Samos the Sage.
          Despite constant warning from the old man, Jak and Daxter "borrowed"
          the local fisherman's boat to venture to Misty Island; a dangerous
          place crawling with ravenous beasts known as lurkers.
        </p>
        <figure id="misty">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/mistyisland.png"
            class="misty"
            alt="misty island"
          />
          <figcaption>Misty Island</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          After sneaking onto Misty Island the boys begin snooping around, when
          they stumble upon two villanous-looking people instructing a crowd of
          lurkers. After the crowd disperses, the boys continue exploring around
          and find a giant pool of dark-eco; a magical precursor essence which
          contains dark power. A lurker brute appears suddenly and lunges
          towards the boys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jak being the brave type he is, picks up a precursor relic and
          attempts to use it in self defense. Unfortunately, the blast launches
          him backward into Daxter, who is standing directly in front of the
          dark-eco pool. A few moments later and something emerges from the
          pool, but it doesn't look like Daxter...
        </p>
        <figure id="ottsel">
          <img
            class="ottsel"
            src="./assets/images/daxter.png"
            alt="visual of an ottsel"
          />
          <figcaption>Daxter as an Ottsel</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          What emerges from the pool of dark-eco certainly is Daxter, but he's a
          little bit shorter. Instead of coming back out normally, he returns
          from the pool in a new form; the form of an Ottsel. An Ottsel is a
          hybrid between an otter and a weasel, with orange and yellow fur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The duo immediately starts panicking and promptly return home to
          Sandover Village. They go to the one person who may know a thing or
          two about this stuff; Samos. Unfortunately for the boys, not only do
          they get lectured by the sage, but Samos also admits that he doesn't
          know the full extent of power that dark-eco has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all hope is lost, however. Samos begins to speak of someone who
          studies dark-eco and may know a way to return Daxter to his human
          form. Far, far to the north lives another sage; Gol Acheron, the
          dark-eco sage. Samos explains how Gol is the only one who would know
          how to revert the effects of the dark eco on Daxter.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this moment on, the duo of Jak and Daxter embark on their long
          journey to far away lands, encountering other sages, monsters, and
          dangerous terrain. Crossing through jungles, mountains, volcanos, and
          oceans to reach this dark-eco expert.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy has a very unique feel to it when
          it comes to gameplay. The premise of the game is platforming combined
          with eco power-ups, riding a giant land-bird, and even venturing
          through dangerous canyons and caverns on a hovering mechanical zoomer.
          The tricky thing about this game however, is you can't take that much
          damage before fainting. If you are at maximum health, you can only
          take damage a total of 4 times before fainting. This mechanic can be
          very unforgiving, but embraces the challenge of this type of game.
        </p>
        <h3>Eco</h3>
        <p>
          The first Jak and Daxter series revolves around energy sources called
          eco. There are 6 different types of eco in the Jak and Daxter
          universe.
        </p>
        <p>The different types of eco are:</p>
        <ul class="eco-list">
          <li class="green-eco">
            <span>Green Eco</span> - The eco of life. Used to heal and
            revitalize.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="blue-eco">
            <span>Blue Eco</span> - The eco of speed. Symbolizes pure
            electricity and energy.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="yellow-eco">
            <span>Yellow Eco</span> - The eco of fire. Used to launch explosive
            projectiles.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="red-eco">
            <span>Red Eco</span> - The eco of strength. Used to give the player
            immense strength.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="dark-eco">
            <span>Dark Eco</span> - The eco of destruction. Used for mutating
            and destroying.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li class="light-eco">
            <span>Light Eco</span> - The eco of purity. Used for healing and
            restoring balance.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure id="ecofigure">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/greeneco.png"
            class="eco-img"
            alt="green eco orbs"
          />
          <figcaption>Mini green-eco orbs</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="travel">
        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>
          In the original Jak and Daxter, there are two modes of travel for the
          player. Aside from the obvious main source being running on foot,
          there are two other methods. The first being a giant land-bird that
          you accidentally hatch at the beginning of the game. It gets all
          confused and assumes Daxter is it's "mama".
        </p>
        <figure id="flutflut">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/flutflut.png"
            class="flutflut"
            alt="a baby flutflut (land-bird)"
          />
          <figcaption>A baby Flut flut</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The Flut flut is a baby bird that travels quickly on land.
          Unfortunately, it's usage is restricted to closed off areas; so you
          can only ride it in those areas. Truly sad as it would be an
          incredible experience to explore the map while riding on that giant
          bird.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two locations that the player uses the Flut flut mount. The
          first being Boggy Swamp, near the Blue Sage's Hut. The area inside
          Boggy Swamp is closed off to where the Flut flut cannot leave.
          Although inside that area the bird is used to jump between elevated
          platforms throughout the swamp to avoid all the muck in the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second area being Snowy Mountain, which is accessed via the
          Gondola near the Red Sage's Hut. In the Snowy Mountains, you use the
          Flut flut to glide across deep caverns to unlock the next area inside
          Snowy Mountain.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The second mode of travel the player uses is the hovering zoomer. A
          mechanical vehicle innovated and designed by Keira, daughter of Samos
          the Green Sage.
        </p>
        <figure id="zoomer">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/zoomer.png"
            class="zoomer"
            alt="zoomer vehicle"
          />
          <figcaption>A zoomer on a transportation pad</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Keira spent a lot of time working on this "A-Grav Zoomer". Jak and
          Daxter's plan was to travel north to find a sage to return Daxter to
          normal. But just as their journey was beginning, there was something
          standing in the way; Fire Canyon. It is a volcanic pass consumed by
          lava and fire while also being the only path to Rock Village from
          Sandover Village.
        </p>
        <p>
          After collecting enough power cells, Keira was able to equip the
          zoomer with a heat shield to withstand the scorching temperatures of
          Fire Canyon; allowing passage to Rock Village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The zoomer, similarly to the Flut flut, is only usable in closed off
          areas. It's usable in Fire Canyon, Misty Island, Precursor Basin, and
          Mountain Pass.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bosses">
        <br />
        <hr />
        <h2>Bosses</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Surprisingly, there are only 3 actual boss encounters in the first Jak
          and Daxter game. As stated previously, you can only be a hit a few
          times before fainting; making some of these boss fights frustrating
          and challenging. The first boss encounter we're going to cover is the
          Dark-Eco Plant.
        </p>
        <h3>Dark Eco Plant</h3>
        <figure id="plantboss">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/plantboss.png"
            class="plantboss"
            alt="Dark Eco Plant"
          />
          <figcaption>Dark Eco Plant</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The Dark Eco Plant boss is hidden deep within the Precursor Temple of
          the Jungle next to Sandover Village. After venturing deep into the
          temple and hopping different platforms, you arrive at the plant's
          chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to know about this boss is it's main attack. The boss
          will often try to lunge it's mouth at the player in attempt to eat
          them. Next, the boss will send little minions out at the player; these
          minions temporarily have spikes which can hurt the player. The player
          must defeat these to progress in the encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the player defeats these minions, the boss will aim it's head
          upward and sprout leaves that the player can climb. This is the only
          time you can strike the boss dealing damage; when you are at the top
          of it next to it's face. Repeat this 3 times and the boss will be
          conquered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the player has to follow these steps in order to win this
          fight:
        </p>
        <ol class="plantfight">
          <li><span>1. </span>Dodge the plant's lunge attacks</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>2. </span>When the minions spawn, wait for their spikes to
            disappear before attacking them
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>3. </span>When the boss sprouts leaves climb to the top next
            to it's face and attack
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>4. </span>Repeat these steps 3 times until the boss is down
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Klaww</h3>
        <p>
          The next boss in this game, known as Klaww, resembles a giant lurker
          with mechanical armor that launches molten rocks at the player.
          Immediately after completing the story around the blue sage's lab,
          Keira uses the blue sage's device to destroy the giant boulder
          blocking the path to the mountain pass.
        </p>

        <figure id="klawwboss">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/klawwboss.png"
            class="klawwboss"
            alt="Klaww boss"
          />
          <figcaption>Klaww</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          However, before you can reach Mountain Pass, you must get past Klaww.
          The premise of this fight is quite unique, in that you have 3 small
          rock platforms to avoid projectiles on. Once you avoid enough of them,
          a ball of blue eco spawns. The blue eco empowers you to automatically
          build a platform which lets you get closer to Klaww, and once you deal
          damage to Klaww you must run away from a large boulder he launches at
          you until you get back to the rock platforms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Similarly to the Dark Eco Plant, the player must follow these steps to
          win the encounter with Klaww:
        </p>
        <ol class="klawwfight">
          <li>
            <span>1. </span>Jump between rock platforms to avoid projectiles
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>2. </span>Once blue eco spawns grab it to build the platform
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>3. </span>At the end of the platform grab yellow eco to fire
            at Klaww
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>4. </span>Run away from the giant boulder back toward rock
            platforms
          </li>
          <br />
          <li><span>5. </span>Repeat 3 times</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Precursor Robot</h3>
        <p>
          The final boss of The Precursor Legacy is Gol & Maia's Precursor
          Robot. The villainous duo has been working on this robot for quite
          some time in an attempt to bust open a dark eco silo, to cover the
          world in dark eco.
        </p>
        <p>
          This boss fight is easily the most challenging throughout the first
          game. It involves many different mechanics and is very easy to slip up
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fight starts out with Jak and Daxter landing on the dark eco silo.
          You grab the nearby yellow eco to fire projectiles at the Robot,
          triggering the fight. After that, the Robot starts powering up a dark
          eco blast. A blue eco vent appears which allows you to use the nearby
          launch pad to propel yourself far into the air to avoid the blast.
        </p>
        <figure id="robotboss">
          <img
            src="./assets/images/robotboss.png"
            class="robotboss"
            alt="Precursor Robot"
          />
          <figcaption>Gol & Maia's <br />Precursor Robot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The next step in the fight is once you land, the Robot summons dark
          eco-infused lurkers from the silo, which you can defeat with the
          nearby yellow eco. Once again the robot launches a blast which you
          avoid by jumping into the air on the jump pad.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, a new mechanic appears where the Robot places orange
          explosives on the silo. Each one blows up and creates a wave that the
          player must jump over to avoid taking damage. After you avoid all the
          waves you can grab yellow eco and fire at the boss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Robot's next mechanic is that it charges up those orange
          explosives in it's arm, creating a larger explosive projectile that
          the player has to dodge. The player is able to fire yellow eco at the
          boss while avoiding the charged-up blasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point in the fight is where the power of the four sages is
          combined to merge each type of eco into a pure form of eco, known as
          light eco. A ball of light eco will be thrown somewhere on the
          platform, and once it comes in contact with the player, a cutscene
          triggers where the player defeats the final boss.
        </p>
        <p>This boss has many mechanics, so to sum up what you must do:</p>
        <ol id="robotfight">
          <li>
            <span>1. </span>Fire yellow eco projectiles at the boss when
            possible
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>2. </span>Use blue eco vents to power up the jump pad when the
            robot is about to blast the whole platform
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>3. </span>Use yellow eco to take down the minions from a range
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>4. </span>When the boss throws orange explosives on the
            ground, time your jumps to be able to avoid all the explosive waves
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span>5. </span>When the Robot charges up big orange explosives,
            fire yellow eco projectiles while it charges up, and dodge when the
            blast comes toward you
          </li>

          Once you finish the last step, a cutscene will trigger that wraps up
          the fight and completes the game. All in all, this boss can be super
          challenging for a lot of players and it's very easy to mess up and
          have to start over; but the challenge of the Jak and Daxter games is
          what makes the series amazing.

          Overall, this game is a core part of the gaming industry. While it was
          lightyears ahead of it's time, it still holds up today; something rare
          to see in modern games. The story of The Precursor Legacy may not be
          the most intricate, however the feel of the game is unmatched. It
          really delivers that nostalgic Jak and Daxter feel to it, even after
          playing the later series games. While there is surely more to come in
          the rest of the Jak and Daxter franchise, this game holds a special
          place in my heart. There is no feeling like that of not playing Jak
          and Daxter for a while, and loading up The Precursor Legacy to get
          that nostalgia trip.
